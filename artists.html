        <h2>Jaysin Jefferson</h2>
        <h4>Jaysin Jefferson has been a graffiti artist for over 30 years. His unique artistic stylings range from large scale murals and portraits to spray painted sculptures.  Those who have seen his work are both amazed and intrigued by his dedication to detail which have made him a premier and sought-after artist.
            He is the owner of Idle Hands Tattoo Parlour in York, PA along with being a loving husband and father. His most recent works have included a rendering of Beetlejuice at the Penn Street Art Bridge, a memorial portrait tribute for the late Kobe Bryant and his daughter, as well as the “Greetings from York” postcard scaling the side of The Yorktowne Hotel. He has been featured in graffiti publications such as Juxtapose and some of his work can still be found in Baltimore if you know where to look.
            We are honored he shares his time, resources, knowledge, and experience to make our projects come to life.</h4>
